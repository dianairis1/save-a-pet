                            <p>At the time of adopting the breed dogs are the most requested, but the mongrel dogs are unique and unrepeatable animals, they are 
                                easier to train and tend to live longer than the breed dogs. The animal protectors are full of dogs that they hope to be adopted. 
                                Animals willing to give affection and company to anyone who gives them a home. But fads and fashions make many people think about

                            <p>Having an animal implies a commitment to it that should never be broken. However, problems like vacations or parties bring with them 
                                thousands of dropouts. Most of the abandoned animals are cubs. Many complete litters are abandoned on roads and rubbish.
